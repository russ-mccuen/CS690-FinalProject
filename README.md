# TaskTracker Project

## Overview
This project is a task manager application that includes functionalities for managing tasks, invoices, and payments. It also includes features for tracking completed tasks, viewing tasks due today, and handling invoices and payments.

## Version History
- **v2.0.0**: Latest release with completed task functionality, invoice and payment tracking, and the necessary infrastructure for testing.

## Testing
Due to technical difficulties, automated tests could not be built for this version of the project. However, a separate file containing the test examples has been included in the project for reference.

### Test File
**You can find the test examples in the `TaskServiceTests.cs` file in the main project folder directly above this README**. These tests are intended to validate the functionality of the `TaskService` class and its methods but were not executed in the current build.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Download the ZIP**: To avoid issues with broken tests, download the ZIP file of the repository, which contains the fully functional code excluding the broken tests.
2. **Extract the ZIP**: Extract the ZIP file to a directory of your choice.
3. **Open the Project**: Open the project in Visual Studio Code or your preferred IDE.
4. **Build the Project**: Run `dotnet build` to build the project.
5. **Run the Project**: Execute `dotnet run` to start the application.

## Future Improvements
- Refactor the code to ensure that tests are fully functional.
- Implement additional features and improve the overall functionality of the application.

Thank you for using the TaskTracker project!
