# TaskTracker Project

## Overview
This project is a task manager application that includes functionalities for managing tasks, invoices, and payments. It also includes features for tracking completed tasks, viewing tasks due today, and handling invoices and payments.

## Version History
- **v2.0.0**: Latest release with completed task functionality, invoice and payment tracking, and the necessary infrastructure for testing.
  
## Testing
Due to technical difficulties, automated tests could not be built for this version of the project. However, a separate file containing the test examples has been included in the project for reference.

### Test File
You can find the test examples in the `TaskTracker.Tests/TaskServiceTests.cs` file. These tests are intended to validate the functionality of the `TaskService` class and its methods but were not executed in the current build.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code or your preferred IDE.
3. Use `dotnet build` to build the project.
4. Run the application with `dotnet run`.

## Future Improvements
- Refactor the code to ensure that tests are fully functional.
- Implement additional features and improve the overall functionality of the application.

Thank you for using the TaskTracker project!
